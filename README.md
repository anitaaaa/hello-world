Hello Humans and Machines,
 
  It is a beautiful afternoon and the degree is 28 C. It feels like burning outside and I'm dancing in my underwear to Adele's "Rolling in the Deep". Her voice makes me thirsty. And this font looks cute. What is it actully? I'd really like to install one on my computer. Looks like ants dancing. Ok, it's changing season. I really need to iron all the shirts hanging there. Bye bye!
  
Love,
Anitaaaa
